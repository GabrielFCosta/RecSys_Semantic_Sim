#### Medidas de similaridade semântica aplicadas a Sistemas de Recomendação com Filtragem Baseada em Conteúdo.

_**Abstract:** The aim of the present work was to develop and evaluate alternative methods for similarity calculation using conventional approaches, 
such as the cosine similarity, in combination with the Wu-Palmer similarity, integrated to the WordNet’s semantic network structure, with the objective of improving the
quality of recommendations in recommender systems with Content-Based Filtering. For this, the Movielens small movie database and the Google Collaboratory’s Python programming environment were used. The results obtained from the experiments indicate that Content-Based Filtering may be improved with the implementation of methods that use semantic similarity measures._
